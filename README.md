# Math For Deep Learning
This repository is a place for me to store the code I write while following the textbook *Math For Deep Learning* by Ronald T. Kneusel. My hope for this project is to have a deeper understanding of the mathematical principles that form the foundation of deep learning. The culmination of this project will be a neural network from scratch.
